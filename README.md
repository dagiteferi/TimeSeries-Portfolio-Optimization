## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on leveraging **time series forecasting** and **portfolio optimization** to enhance investment strategies for **Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments**. Using historical financial data for **Tesla (TSLA)**, **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)**, and **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**, the project aims to:
- Predict future stock prices using advanced forecasting models like **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **LSTM**.
- Optimize portfolio allocation to maximize returns while minimizing risks.
- Provide actionable insights for financial analysts to make data-driven investment decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare historical financial data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, volatility, and key metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) and Sharpe Ratio.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Implement ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models to predict future stock prices.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Optimize asset allocation using covariance matrices and risk-return analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Generate interactive charts and graphs for forecasts and portfolio performance.
